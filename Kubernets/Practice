Kubernete
----------

Container Orchestration tool

Docker swam -> supports only docker

kubernetes supports most of the tools


Architecture :
-------------

KUBCTL -> command line to intract with master

URL : https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/

Config file -> describes what is expected

---MASTER--

> API server gateway  -> this is the main building block , which process the config file
> ETCD -> database that stores info about worker nodes/pods and other related details
> Scheduled -> it identifies whihc PODS to pick to start work on..
> Controller -> it holds details about Worker node health/authorization/authentication etc...

--WORKER--

Cluster -> collection of worker node
Inside worker node :
KUBELET -> it will receives request from controller and perform almost all weightlifting tasks like downloaing image etc..
Proxy -> allows pods to expose to outside world
PODS -> collection of containers
basically if we have multiple containers, that means only one will br main and remaining all will be supportive container for main one
