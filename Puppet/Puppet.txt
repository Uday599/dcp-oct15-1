1. Given a sample puppet DSL file with a resource to Configure the NTP package on a server. Update the value of ensure attribute to set it to "present"

    vi puppet-ntp-config.yml

package { 'ntp':
  ensure => present
}


2.  Add a new resource - file to modify the file /etc/ntp.conf. In this step only add the file resource to modify /etc/ntp.conf. 
    In the next step we will add the attributes to modify the file
    
    vi puppet-ntp-config.yml
    
package { 'ntp':
  ensure => "present"
}

file { '/etc/ntp.conf':

}


3. Add two attributes to the file resource. 

    ensure => "present" : This is to instruct Puppet to ensure that the given line is present in the file 
    content => "server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst\n" : This is the line to be added to the config file
    
   vi puppet-ntp-config.yml
   
   
package { 'ntp':
  ensure => "present"
}

file { "/etc/ntp.conf":
  ensure => "present",
  content => "server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst\n",

}


4. Introduction: We will now add a new resource to start the NTPD service on the system 

Instruction: Add a new resource - service and configure it to start the ntpd service. Ensure the service is running.


vi puppet-ntp-config.yml

    package { "ntp":
      ensure => "present"
    }
    file { "/etc/ntp.conf":
      ensure  => "present",
      content => "server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst\n"
    }
    service { "ntpd":
      ensure => "running"
    }
    
    
    
==============================================
PUPPET CLASSES
==============================================

1.Introduction: In this coding exercise we will get familiar with Puppet Classes. Given the file we created in the previous exercise to configure NTP. 

Instruction: Encapsulate the given Puppet code into a class named ntpdemo.

vi puppet-config-class.yml

    class ntpdemo{
      package { 'ntp':
        ensure => "present"
      }
     
      file { "/etc/ntp.conf":
        ensure  => "present",
        content => "server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst\n"
      }
     
      service { "ntpd":
        ensure  => "running"
      }
    }
    
    
    2. Introduction: We have now created a class with the ntp configuration resources.  Let us now use it by declaring the class 

Instruction: Declare the ntpdemo class which was defined in the last exercises in the same code using "include" Puppet keyword


vi puppet-config-class.yml

    class ntpdemo{
      package { 'ntp':
        ensure => "present"
      }
     
      file { "/etc/ntp.conf":
        ensure  => "present",
        content => "server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst\n"
      }
     
      service { "ntpd":
        ensure  => "running"
      }
    }
     
    include ntpdemo
