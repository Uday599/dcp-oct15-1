VM -> will have os -> hypervisor -> each differecnt os -> application

Containers 

we dont have different OS's here , only underlying main OS will be used to run application 
Here we have entity called 'Docker' like hypervisor in VMs

*  Container runtime environment -> docker

each service in docker will have its own tree directory structure , hence making sure that it is isolated from other servcies

Hypervisor is for physical hardware virtualization.


LXC AND DOCKER :
---------------

Linux Containers (LXC) is an OS-level virtualization technology that enables you to create and run multiple Linux operating systems (OS) simultaneously on a single Linux machine (LXC host). LXC provides a set of tools to manage your container as well as templates to create a virtual environment of the most common Linux OS.

Docker is an open-source containerization technology that focuses on running a single application in an isolated environment. Its Docker Engine enables you to create, run, or distribute containers. You can also share applications and collaborate with other developers using Docker Hub.

Docker Daemon 
docker group   - /etc/group  = to add user , by default only root can run docker


[root@ip-172-31-1-219 ~]# docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
2db29710123e: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:faa03e786c97f07ef34423fccceeec2398ec8a5759259f94d99078f264e9d7af
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

# containers uses different namespace to isolate
1. using process id
ps -eaf # gives process info
ps -eaf | grep   # in host machine


All containers used default infra from host machine,
if we are running a process in container that actually mean we are running process in host but with different PID

Docker hub - registry for docker images

docker pull nginx:<tag_id>        # to pull dedicated tag image

docker run centos <command>
docker run centos sleep 20 # by default runs in foreground mode


 which docker
cd container_id
    
 docker run --name myweb -p 7090:80 -d nginx
     
   -- what above command does is : 
   > it will run container NGINX on port 80 (we need to know which service runs on which port , for Nginx it is 80)
   > consider nginx is runnning in private subnet , so do access this service from internet, we have to link internet -> public Ip host -> map to port 80 in private subnet.
   > here 7090 is the host ip (any port)
   > -d is detach , that means , when running this service , our terminal will not be freezed , that means we will have control on our terminal.
   > --name myweb is like giving name for this particular container process.
   > by defualt run command runs in foreground causing not to have access to terminal
      
docker run --name myweb -d -P nginx  -> capital P is for automatically doing port mapping
docker ps -a  # to see port
   
docker ps
docker stop 579d293a4641  # to stop the container
dockar start <image>
docker ps -a

#Docker Installation | Configuration | Commands & Concepts:


image = class

containers  = objects to call class(image)
dependencies and all will be there in containers
Registry - place where you store docker images
you can host your own registry / docker hub

sudo yum install docker


yum install docker -y
docker version
systemctl status docker
systemctl start docker
systemctl status docker
systemctl enable docker





#Basic Docker Commands :

#goto : https://hub.docker.com/

#Test Docker with basic hello-world image from docker hub.


 # by default lates tag will be pulled if not you can mention the required tag to download
docker pull centos 
docker pull centos:tag

docker run centos 

docker run centos
docker run nginx

docker pull hello-world
docker pull docker/whalesay


docker images

docker run centos

docker ps     --> this is used to get running containers
docker ps -a    --> this is used to get list of containes - running/stopped/exited etc...

### Run Container in Interactive Mode:
###docker run -it --name=testvol1 centos bash  # run command will pull image from docker hub, ok but start is to start already installed container-image
docker run -it centos bash

i -> interactive mode
t -> in termainal

docker run -it <images> bash

root@a0303e44cb9e:/usr/local/tomcat#

root@<container_id): interactive mode


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
docker pull loksaieta/loksaimvndevops:v1.0

cat /etc/*release*  
docker run python:3,6 cat /etc/*release*   -> to know the base OS on which this container is running.

### Print the Docker Centos Image Release Info.
dockerpath# cat /etc/*release*
dockerpath# exit

###Run Docker Container in DETACHED MODE : we can gain access to terminal
docker run -d centos sleep 20 
docker ps -a

###Run Docker Container in FOREGROUND MODE :
docker run centos sleep 20
docker ps -a

docker run -d centos sleep 200
docker stop <container_id>

docker rm 2c5b1b4f   # to remove container

docker images
docker rmi <image_id>  # to remove image

### Before deleting image, ensure that it is not referenced to any container. 
### In it is mapped, delete the container first, then can re container image.

docker rmi -f hello-world

docker pull centos:centos7.9.2009  # using tag to pull image

docker run centos sleep 1100

docker stop <container_id>
docker rm <contained_ip>

docket rmi <imaged_id>  - to remove the image from local machine

### Detached Mode
docker run -d centos sleep 2000

docker attach <running_container_id>  -- to attach back to default mode i.e foreground mode , default
docker stop <container_id>

###docker pull timer

#docker pull jenkins

#docker run jenkins

docker inspect <container_id>   -- to get details of containers

docker history <imagename>  # to get the various layers of image, can be seen in docker hub

docker run tomcat # default runs in foreground mode, use case: when tomcat is running , I want nobody to change/edit something in terminal so we use foreground

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Port-Mapping / Port-Binding
================================

1.
goto hub.docker & search for tomcat

docker run -it -p 8088:8080 tomcat:8.0  # this mappes to specific port

# docker run -it -p host_port:container_port

Once you install tomcat on container not on VM , very fast and easy:

<public_ip>:<host_port>  # 8088


2.
docker run -p <IP>:<hostPort>:<containerPort> -d <imageNam>  #  Host network driver is required
# Mapping to sepecific ip

[root@ip-172-31-39-243 ~]# curl http://127.0.0.0:8080/  # you can verify this way
curl: (7) Couldn't connect to server


3.
Run an instance of kodekloud/simple-web with tag- blue and map port 8080 on the container to 38282 on the host 

###Docker Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

docker logs <container_id>  # to get logs

#Access Docker contents using 

- Non-Interactive Mode:

# docket run -it is to run container in interactive mode, whereas how to login/enter into already running container? we use "exec" command
 
docker exec <container_id/container_name> <any bash command>
docker exec container_id cat /etc/hosts # this will execute this command inside container # container should be running ok before running "exec" command

docker exec myweb ls / 

bin
boot
dev
docker-entrypoint.d
docker-entrypoint.sh
etc
home
lib
lib64
media
mnt
opt
proc
root
run
sbin
srv
sys
tmp
usr
var


>  see we have our own container directory structure

docker exec < container_id> <bash_command>

docker exec e8553a4721d5 cat /etc/hosts

#Login to Docker Container using exec in Interactive Mode: (Using Container Name) 

docker exec -it <container_name-gallant_blackburn> bash

#Run Docker Image in Interactive Mode: (Using Image Name) 

docker run -it centos bash
dockerpath# cat /etc/*release*
dockerpath# exit

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
to get into containers and execute some command to do some changes (not recommended)

we do :

docker exec -it <container_id/container_name> /bin/bash

> what we are doing here is
i -> interactive
t -> terminal

so we are allowing bash script to execute in specified container
> we can install , run do whatever we want inside the container

exit
> it will throws us out from containers and we will return back to host machine

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOCKER LOGS
------------
ALways run inspect command first to know , how containers installation happens and condition it checks!
 
 docker inspect <image_id>  # to know complete info about container , same thing is being pullled from docket hub but seen in terminal
 docker inspect 76c69feac34e

    docker run --name Mysql -d -P mysql:5.7.40   -> this will run and intall mysql:5.7.40
    docker ps   -> will give list of running process
    docker ps -a  -> all process list
    docker images -> will give list of images installed
    docker logs Mysql -> this will give logs about Mysql process
    docker run --name Mysql1 -d -P -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mypass mysql:5.7.40  -> -e is for providing export variables
    docker ps
    docker logs Mysql1

Environmental varibles:
----------------------

# when we want to change some parameter , say background color for each time, each container then we will make that variable as environmental variable and define them while running container.

docker run -e APP_COLOR=blue <image_name>

# similarly if we want to run MYSQL container, then we should define env variable "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" .

 docker run --name some-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/mysql-root -d mysql:tag


# you can refer official image from docker hub
